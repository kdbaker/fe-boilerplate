# CSS - Base
All native HTML element styling. Don't use ID or CLASS selectors here.

From [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)

**Base** rules are the defaults. A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.
